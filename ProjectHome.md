WoW Model Viewer is an application that uses the WoW MPQ files to create map models that can be used for graphics or machinima. The project was originally created by Ufo\_Z and Darjk, who left the source code for developers to build upon and update should the need arise. It did.

This project is an adaptation of the original project updated for Wrath of the Lich King. It includes most of the features in the original WoW Model Viewer, but some of the features and models still do not work properly.
